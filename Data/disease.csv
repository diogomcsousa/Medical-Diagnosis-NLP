achalasia;Achalasia is a rare disorder that makes it difficult for food and liquid to pass from the swallowing tube connecting your mouth and stomach (esophagus) into your stomach. Occurs when nerves in the esophagus become damaged.;There's no cure for achalasia. Once the esophagus is paralyzed, the muscle cannot work properly again. But symptoms can usually be managed with endoscopy, minimally invasive therapy or surgery.
acne;Acne starts when greasy secretions from the skin's sebaceous glands (oil glands) plug the tiny openings for hair follicles (plugged pores). If the openings are large, the clogs take the form of blackheads: small, flat spots with dark centers. If the openings stay small, the clogs take the form of whiteheads: small, flesh-colored bumps. Acne lesions are most common on the face, but they can also occur on the neck, chest, back, shoulders, and upper arms.;Nonprescription treatment for Acne includes soap and water, cleansers, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulfur, topical retinol gel or creams, alcohol and acetone.
aids;Human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV weakens a person's ability to fight infections. It is mostly contracted through unprotected sex or needle sharing.;An HIV test confirms diagnosis. Medications suppress the virus to help you stay healthy, prevent the spread of HIV, and delay or prevent the onset of AIDS. With treatment, HIV-positive persons can live normal, healthy lives.
alcoholic hepatitis;Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver that leads to liver cell damage and cell death. Alcoholic hepatitis is caused by drinking too much alcohol. The liver breaks down alcohol and if, over time, you drink more alcohol than the liver can process, it can become seriously damaged.;Alcoholic hepatitis can be diagnosed through blood tests (liver function, blood cell counts, bleeding times, electrolyte tests), ultrasound of the abdomen, CT scan, MRI, liver biopsy
allergy;Allergy happens when your immune system reacts to something that’s usually harmless. Those triggers, which doctors call "allergens," can include pollen, mold, and animal dander, certain foods, or things that irritate your skin.;Skin testing is the most widely used and the most helpful in finding the cause of allergies. There are several different methods, but all involve exposing the skin to small amounts of various substances and observing the reactions over time. Specific IgE tests generally identify IgE antibodies to specific antigens, or allergy triggers. The body produces antibodies to fight invaders, or allergens. Other tests involve eliminating certain allergens from your environment and then re-introducing them to see if a reaction occurs.
alzheimer's disease; Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia. Dementia is a general term for symptoms of mental decline that interfere with a person’s daily life. It is not a normal part of aging.; Alzheimer's can be diagnosed with tests of memory, problem solving, attention, counting. Brain scans as CT scan, MRI and PET can be used to rule out other possible causes for this symptoms observing lesions in specific areas of the brain.
anemia;Anemia is a condition in which you lack enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your body's tissues. Having anemia can make you feel tired and weak.;Treatments for anemia range from taking supplements to undergoing medical procedures. You might be able to prevent some types of anemia by eating a healthy, varied diet.
angina;Angina is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart and can also be a symptom of coronary artery disease.;Stable angina is the most common form of angina. It usually happens when you exert yourself and goes away with rest. For example, pain that comes on when you're walking uphill or in the cold weather may be angina. If your chest pain lasts longer than a few minutes and doesn't go away when you rest or take your angina medications, it may be a sign you're having a heart attack.
ankylosing spondylitis;Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disease that, over time, can cause some of the small bones in your spine (vertebrae) to fuse. This fusing makes the spine less flexible and can result in a hunched-forward posture. If ribs are affected, it can be difficult to breathe deeply.;Seek medical attention if you have low back or buttock pain that came on slowly, is worse in the morning or awakens you from your sleep in the second half of the night — particularly if this pain improves with exercise and worsens with rest. See an eye specialist immediately if you develop a painful red eye, severe light sensitivity or blurred vision.
anorexia nervosa;Anorexia nervosa, also called anorexia, is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder that is characterized by self-starvation and excessive weight loss. The disorder is diagnosed when a person weighs at least 15% less than their normal/ideal body weight. Extreme weight loss in people with anorexia nervosa can lead to dangerous health problems and even death.;Treatment for anorexia must address both psychological and physical problems. The treatment team should include a mental health professional and a primary care doctor.
appendicitis;Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix.; It's a medical emergency that almost always requires surgery as soon as possible to remove the appendix.
arrhythmia;An arrhythmia is an uneven heartbeat. It means your heart is out of its usual rhythm. Arrhythmias can be an emergency, or they could be harmless. If you feel something unusual happening with your heartbeat, get medical help right away so doctors can find out why it's happening and what you need to do about it.;To diagnose arrhythmia or find its cause tests such as EKG, Holter monitor, Event monitor, Implantable loop recorder, Stress test, Echocardiogram, Cardiac catheterization, Electrophysiology study and Head-up tilt table test can be conducted by the doctor.
arthritis;Arthritis is the swelling and tenderness of one or more of your joints. The main symptoms of arthritis are joint pain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age. The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.;Treatments vary depending on the type of arthritis. The main goals of arthritis treatments are to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.
asthma;Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, a whistling sound (wheezing) when you breathe out and shortness of breath.; Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it's important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust your treatment as needed. A major concern with atrial fibrillation is the potential to develop blood clots within the upper chambers of the heart.;
atopic dermatitis;Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a condition that makes your skin red and itchy. It's common in children but can occur at any age. Atopic dermatitis is long lasting (chronic) and tends to flare periodically.;No lab test is needed to identify atopic dermatitis (eczema). Your doctor will likely make a diagnosis by examining your skin and reviewing your medical history.
atrial fibrillation;Atrial fibrillation is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase your risk of strokes, heart failure and other heart-related complications. During atrial fibrillation, the heart's two upper chambers (the atria) beat chaotically and irregularly.;To diagnose atrial fibrillation or find its cause tests such as EKG, Holter monitor, Event monitor, Implantable loop recorder, Stress test, Echocardiogram, Cardiac catheterization, Electrophysiology study and Head-up tilt table test can be conducted by the doctor.
bipolar disorder;Bipolar disorder , also known as manic depression, is a mental illness that brings severe high and low moods and changes in sleep, energy, thinking, and behavior.;The evaluation to determine the diagnosis include physical exam, psychiatric assessment, mood charting and assessment of criteria for bipolar disorder published by the American Psychiatric Association.
carpal tunnel syndrome;Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by pressure on the median nerve. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway surrounded by bones and ligaments on the palm side of your hand. When the median nerve is compressed, the symptoms can include numbness, tingling and weakness in the hand and arm.;Steps to a doctor diagnosis include physical examination, X-ray, Electromyography and Nerve conduction study.
cataracts;A cataract is a clouding of the normally clear lens of your eye. At first, stronger lighting and eyeglasses can help you deal with cataracts. But if impaired vision interferes with your usual activities, you might need cataract surgery. Fortunately, cataract surgery is generally a safe, effective procedure.; Steps to a doctor diagnosis include visual acuity test, slit-lamp examination and retinal exam.
cervical spondylosis;Cervical spondylosis is a general term for age-related wear and tear affecting the spinal disks in your neck. As the disks dehydrate and shrink, signs of osteoarthritis develop, including bony projections along the edges of bones (bone spurs).;Most people experience no symptoms from these problems. When symptoms do occur, nonsurgical treatments often are effective. Imaging tests such as neck X-ray, CT scan, MRI and myelography and nerve function tests including electromyography and nerve conduction study are performed for a concrete diagnosis.
chicken pox;Chicken pox is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It causes an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. In otherwise healthy children, chickenpox typically needs no medical treatment. Your doctor may prescribe an antihistamine to relieve itching. Chicken pox is highly contagious to people who haven't had the disease or been vaccinated against it.;The chickenpox vaccine is a safe, effective way to prevent chickenpox and its possible complications.
chronic cholestasis;Cholestasis is a liver disease. It occurs when the flow of bile from your liver is reduced or blocked. Bile is fluid produced by your liver that aids in the digestion of food, especially fats.;Blood tests may be ordered to test for liver enzymes that indicate cholestasis. If test results are abnormal, your doctor may order imaging tests like ultrasound or MRI. Your doctor may also perform a liver biopsy.
cold;The common cold is a viral infection of your nose and throat (upper respiratory tract). It's usually harmless, although it might not feel that way. Many types of viruses can cause a common cold.;There's no cure for the common cold. Most cases of the common cold get better without treatment, usually within a week to 10 days. But a cough may linger for a few more days.
concussion;A concussion is a traumatic brain injury that affects your brain function. Effects are usually temporary but can include headaches and problems with concentration, memory, balance and coordination. Concussions are usually caused by a blow to the head.;Your doctor will evaluate your signs and symptoms, review your medical history, conduct a neurological examination, cognitive testing and imaging tests.
copd;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. Symptoms include breathing difficulty, cough, mucus (sputum) production and wheezing. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common conditions that contribute to COPD.;Tests to diagnose the severity of the condition may include: Lung function tests, chest X-ray, CT scan and arterial blood gas analysis. Many people with COPD have mild forms of the disease for which little therapy is needed other than smoking cessation.
coronary artery disease;Coronary artery disease develops when the major blood vessels that supply your heart become damaged or diseased. Cholesterol-containing deposits (plaques) in your coronary arteries and inflammation are usually to blame for coronary artery disease. Because coronary artery disease often develops over decades, you might not notice a problem until you have a significant blockage or a heart attack.;Tests to diagnose the severity of the condition may include: Electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, exercise stress test, nuclear stress test, cardiac catheterization and angiogram, cardiac CT scan.
crohn's disease;Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Inflammation caused by Crohn's disease can involve different areas of the digestive tract in different people. This inflammation often spreads into the deeper layers of the bowel.;The doctor will likely use a combination of tests to help confirm a diagnosis of Crohn's disease, including: blood tests, stool studies, colonoscopy, CT scan, MRI, capsule endoscopy, balloon-assisted enteroscopy.
chronic dermatitis;Chronic eczema (or dermatitis) refers to a longstanding irritable area. It is often darker than the surrounding skin, thickened and much scratched.;Dermatitis is often a long-term problem. When you notice your skin getting dry, moisturise your skin again and carefully avoid the use of soap. If the itchy rash returns, use both the moisturiser and the steroid cream or ointment. If it fails to improve within two weeks, see your doctor for further advice.
deep vein thrombosis;Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one or more of the deep veins in your body, usually in your legs. You can get DVT if you have certain medical conditions that affect how your blood clots. A blood clot in your legs can also happen if you don't move for a long time, such as after you have surgery or an accident, when you're traveling a long distance, or when you're on bed rest.;Tests to diagnose the severity of the condition may include: D-dimer blood test, duplex ultrasound, venography, MRI.
degenerative disk disease;Degenerative disk disease is when normal changes that take place in the disks of your spine cause pain.;The doctor may order an X-ray or MRI to check for bone or nerve damage near your spine.
dengue;Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne illness that occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. The severe form of dengue fever, also called dengue hemorrhagic fever, can cause serious bleeding, a sudden drop in blood pressure (shock) and death.;Diagnosing dengue fever can be difficult because its signs and symptoms can be easily confused with those of other diseases. For that reason, it is very important to be sure of the medical and travel history.
depression;Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems.;The diagnosis can be determined based on physical exam, blood tests, psychiatric evaluation and DSM-5 (criteria listed in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).
diabetes 1;Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone needed to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy.;Diagnostic tests include: Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test, random blood sugar test, fasting blood sugar test.
diabetes 2;Type 2 diabetes is an impairment in the way the body regulates and uses sugar (glucose) as a fuel. This long-term (chronic) condition results in too much sugar circulating in the bloodstream. In type 2 diabetes, there are primarily two interrelated problems at work. Your pancreas does not produce enough insulin — a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells — and cells respond poorly to insulin and take in less sugar.;Diagnostic tests include: Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test, random blood sugar test, fasting blood sugar test.
diarrhea;Diarrhea — loose, watery and possibly more-frequent bowel movements — is a common problem.;Most cases of diarrhea clear on their own within a couple of days without treatment.
diverticulitis;Diverticula are small, bulging pouches that can form in the lining of your digestive system. They are found most often in the lower part of the large intestine (colon). The presence of diverticula is known as diverticulosis. When one or more of the pouches become inflamed, and in some cases infected, that condition is known as diverticulitis.;A CT scan, which can identify inflamed or infected pouches and confirm a diagnosis of diverticulitis. CT can also indicate the severity of diverticulitis and guide treatment.
drug reaction;A drug allergy is the abnormal reaction of your immune system to a medication. Any medication — over-the-counter, prescription or herbal — is capable of inducing a drug allergy. However, a drug allergy is more likely with certain medications.;Physical examination and detailed information about the onset of symptoms, the time you took medications, and improvement or worsening of symptoms are important clues for helping to make a diagnosis.
ear infection;An ear infection (sometimes called acute otitis media) is an infection of the middle ear, the air-filled space behind the eardrum that contains the tiny vibrating bones of the ear.;An instrument called a pneumatic otoscope is often the only specialized tool a doctor needs to diagnose an ear infection. This instrument enables the doctor to look in the ear and judge whether there is fluid behind the eardrum. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis more tests can be performed such as tympanometry, acoustic, reflectometry and tympanocentesis.
endometriosis;Endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which tissue similar to the tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus — the endometrium — grows outside your uterus. Endometriosis most commonly involves your ovaries, fallopian tubes and the tissue lining your pelvis. Rarely, endometrial-like tissue may be found beyond the area where pelvic organs are located.;The diagnosis can be determined based on  pelvic exam, ultrasound, MRI and laparoscopy,
fibromyalgia;Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain and spinal cord process painful and nonpainful signals.;In the past, doctors would check 18 specific points on a person's body to see how many of them were painful when pressed firmly. Newer guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology don't require a tender point exam. Instead, the main factor needed for a fibromyalgia diagnosis is widespread pain throughout your body for at least three months.
flu;Influenza is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs.;During times when influenza is widespread, you may not need to be tested for influenza. Your doctor may diagnose you based on your signs and symptoms.
food poisoning;Food poisoning, also called foodborne illness, is illness caused by eating contaminated food. Infectious organisms — including bacteria, viruses and parasites — or their toxins are the most common causes of food poisoning.;Food poisoning is often diagnosed based on a detailed history, including how long you've been sick, your symptoms and specific foods you've eaten. Your doctor will also perform a physical exam, looking for signs of dehydration.
fungal infection;A fungal infection, also called mycosis, is a skin disease caused by a fungus. Fungal skin infections can happen anywhere on your body. Some of the most common are athlete's foot, jock itch, ringworm, and yeast infections.;The doctor will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam. They might also take a sample from the affected area to look at under a microscope.
gastroenteritis;The most common way to develop viral gastroenteritis — often called stomach flu —is through contact with an infected person or by ingesting contaminated food or water.;The doctor will likely diagnose gastroenteritis based on symptoms, a physical exam and sometimes on the presence of similar cases in your community. A rapid stool test can detect rotavirus or norovirus.
gerd;Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when stomach acid frequently flows back into the tube connecting your mouth and stomach (esophagus). This backwash (acid reflux) can irritate the lining of your esophagus.;To confirm a diagnosis of GERD, or to check for complications might be recommended to do: upper endoscopy, ambulatory acid probe test, esophageal manometry, X-ray of upper digestive system.
heart attack;A heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is blocked. The blockage is most often a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances, which form a plaque in the arteries that feed the heart (coronary arteries).;Tests to diagnose a heart attack include: electrocardiogram, blood tests (check for proteins or enzymes), chest X-ray, echocardiogram, angiogram, cardiac CT and MRI.
heart failure;Heart failure — sometimes known as congestive heart failure — occurs when the heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should. When this happens, blood often backs up and fluid can build up in the lungs, causing shortness of breath.;After the physical exam, the doctor may also order some of these tests: blood tests, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, stress test, CT scan, coronary angiogram, myocardial biopsy.
hemorrhoids;Hemorrhoids, also called piles, are swollen veins in your anus and lower rectum, similar to varicose veins. Hemorrhoids can develop inside the rectum (internal hemorrhoids) or under the skin around the anus (external hemorrhoids).;Diagnosing internal hemorrhoids might include examination of your anal canal and rectum.
hepatitis a;Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus is one of several types of hepatitis viruses that cause inflammation and affect your liver's ability to function. You're most likely to get hepatitis A from contaminated food or water or from close contact with a person or object that's infected.;Blood tests are used to look for signs of the hepatitis A virus in your body.
hepatitis b;Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). For some people, hepatitis B infection becomes chronic, meaning it lasts more than six months. Having chronic hepatitis B increases your risk of developing liver failure, liver cancer or cirrhosis.;The doctor will examine you and look for signs of liver damage, such as yellowing skin or belly pain. Blood tests, liver ultrasound and liver biopsy can help identify Hepatitis B complications.
hepatitis c;Hepatitis C is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation, sometimes leading to serious liver damage. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) spreads through contaminated blood.;Doctors typically use one or more of the following tests to assess liver damage in chronic hepatitis C: MRE, transient elastography, liver biopsy, blood tests.
hepatitis d;Hepatitis D is a liver infection you can get if you have hepatitis B. It can cause serious symptoms that can lead to lifelong liver damage and even death. It’s sometimes called hepatitis delta virus (HDV) or delta hepatitis.;The doctor will ask questions about your symptoms and lifestyle, then do an exam. They’ll test the blood for the different types of hepatitis. If you have it, the doctor will do more bloodwork and imaging tests to check the liver for signs of damage.
hepatitis e;Hepatitis E is a virus that infects your liver. It can cause your liver to swell up. Most people with hepatitis E get better within a few months. Usually it doesn’t lead to long-term illness or liver damage like some other forms of hepatitis do. But hepatitis E can be dangerous for pregnant women or anyone with weak immune systems, including the elderly or people who are ill.;The doctor will ask for your medical history and details about your symptoms. Tell your doctor about any recent travel. Tell them if you think you might have had contact with water contaminated by sewage. A blood test or a stool test can also be used to diagnose hepatitis E.
hypertension;High blood pressure (hypertension) is a common condition in which the long-term force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease.;Uncontrolled high blood pressure increases your risk of serious health problems, including heart attack and stroke. Fortunately, high blood pressure can be easily detected. And once you know you have high blood pressure, you can work with your doctor to control it.
hyperthyroidism;Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) occurs when your thyroid gland produces too much of the hormone thyroxine. Hyperthyroidism can accelerate your body's metabolism, causing unintentional weight loss and a rapid or irregular heartbeat.;To diagnose this condition physical exam and blood tests (TSH) might be conducted.
hypoglycemia;Hypoglycemia is a condition in which your blood sugar (glucose) level is lower than normal. Glucose is your body's main energy source. Hypoglycemia is often related to diabetes treatment. But other drugs and a variety of conditions — many rare — can cause low blood sugar in people who don't have diabetes.;If you use insulin or another diabetes medication to lower your blood sugar, and you have signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, test your blood sugar levels with a blood glucose meter. If the result shows low blood sugar (under 70 mg/dL), treat accordingly. In addition, your doctor will likely conduct a physical examination and review your medical history.
hypothyroidism;Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain crucial hormones. Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in the early stages. Over time, untreated hypothyroidism can cause a number of health problems, such as obesity, joint pain, infertility and heart disease.;In general, your doctor may test for an underactive thyroid if you are feeling increasingly tired, have dry skin, constipation and weight gain, or have had previous thyroid problems or a goiter.
impetigo;Impetigo is a common and highly contagious skin infection that mainly affects infants and young children. It usually appears as reddish sores on the face, especially around the nose and mouth and on the hands and feet. Over about a week, the sores burst and develop honey-colored crusts.;To diagnose impetigo, your doctor might look for sores on your face or body. Lab tests generally aren't needed. If the sores don't clear, even with antibiotic treatment, your doctor might take a sample of the liquid produced by a sore and test it to see what types of antibiotics would work best on it. Some types of the bacteria that cause impetigo have become resistant to certain antibiotics.
infectious arthritis;Infectious arthritis (also called Septic arthritis) is a painful infection in a joint that can come from germs that travel through your bloodstream from another part of your body. Septic arthritis can also occur when a penetrating injury, such as an animal bite or trauma, delivers germs directly into the joint.;To determine this diagnosis test such as joint fluid analysis, blood tests and imaging tests might be performed.
irritable bowel syndrome;Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder that affects the large intestine. IBS is a chronic condition that you'll need to manage long term.;There's no test to definitively diagnose IBS. Your doctor is likely to start with a complete medical history, physical exam and tests to rule out other conditions, such as celiac disease.
jaundice;Jaundice is a condition in which the skin, sclera (whites of the eyes) and mucous membranes turn yellow. This yellow color is caused by a high level of bilirubin, a yellow-orange bile pigment. Bile is fluid secreted by the liver. Bilirubin is formed from the breakdown of red blood cells.;Doctors diagnose jaundice by checking for signs of liver disease such as bruising of the skin, spider angiomas and palmar erythema.
kidney stone;Kidney stones (also called renal calculi, nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis) are hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside your kidneys.;The diagnostic tests may include: blood testing, urine testing, imaging tests (CT scan, X-ray) and analysis of passed stones.
laryngitis;Laryngitis is an inflammation of your voice box (larynx) from overuse, irritation or infection.;These techniques sometimes are used to help diagnose laryngitis: laryngoscopy and biopsy (if the doctor observes a suspicious area).
lichen planus;Lichen planus is a condition that can cause swelling and irritation in the skin, hair, nails and mucous membranes. In the mouth, vagina and other areas covered by a mucous membrane, lichen planus forms lacy white patches, sometimes with painful sores.;The diagnosis of lichen planus is based on your symptoms, your medical history, a physical examination and, if necessary, the results of lab tests. These tests may include: biopsy, Hepatitis C test, allergy tests.
lyme disease;Lyme disease is caused by four main species of bacteria. Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii cause Lyme disease in the United States, while Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are the leading causes in Europe and Asia. The most common tick-borne illness in these regions, Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected black-legged tick, commonly known as a deer tick.;Lab tests to identify antibodies to the bacteria can help confirm or rule out the diagnosis.
malaria;Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite. The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. People who have malaria usually feel very sick with a high fever and shaking chills. While the disease is uncommon in temperate climates, malaria is still common in tropical and subtropical countries.;To diagnose malaria, your doctor will likely review your medical history and recent travel, conduct a physical exam, and order blood tests.
migraine;A migraine is a headache that can cause severe throbbing pain or a pulsing sensation, usually on one side of the head.;If your condition is unusual, complex or suddenly becomes severe, tests to rule out other causes for your pain might include: MRI and CT scan.
multiple sclerosis;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body.;There are no specific tests for MS. Instead, a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis often relies on ruling out other conditions that might produce similar signs and symptoms, known as a differential diagnosis.
myocarditis;Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium). The inflammation can reduce your heart's ability to pump and cause rapid or abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias).;Early diagnosis of myocarditis is important to preventing long-term heart damage. After a physical examination, your doctor might order one or more tests to confirm that you have myocarditis and determine its severity. Tests to diagnose myocarditis might include: ECG or EKG, chest X-ray, cardiac MRI, echocardiogram, blood tests, cardiac catheterization and heart muscle biopsy.
narcolepsy;Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep.;Your doctor may make a preliminary diagnosis of narcolepsy based on your excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy).
nephritis;Nephritis is the inflammation of the kidneys. It has a range of causes and can be acute or chronic. Early symptoms may include changes in the color of the urine and swelling of the hands and feet.;A doctor will check for signs and ask the patient about symptoms. The following tests may also be ordered: blood tests, urine test, kidney CT scan, MRI, kidney biopsy, chest X-ray, glomerular filtration rate.
osteoarthritis;Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. It occurs when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of the bones wears down over time.;During the physical exam, your doctor will check your affected joint for tenderness, swelling, redness and flexibility.
paralysis (brain hemorrhage);A brain hemorrhage is a type of stroke. It's caused by an artery in the brain bursting and causing localized bleeding in the surrounding tissues. This bleeding kills brain cells.;Once you see a doctor, they can determine which part of the brain is affected based on your symptoms. Doctors may run a variety of imaging tests, such as a CT scan, which can reveal internal bleeding or blood accumulation, or an MRI. A neurological exam or eye exam, which can show swelling of the optic nerve, may also be performed. A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is usually not performed, as it may be dangerous and make things worse.
parkinson's disease;Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Although Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medications might significantly improve your symptoms.;No specific test exists to diagnose Parkinson's disease. Your doctor trained in nervous system conditions (neurologist) will diagnose Parkinson's disease based on your medical history, a review of your signs and symptoms, and a neurological and physical examination.
paroxysmal positional vertigo;Paroxysmal positional vertigo is one of the most common causes of vertigo — the sudden sensation that you're spinning or that the inside of your head is spinning.;A physical examination might be conducted to determine the cause of dizziness. Further tests may include: Electronystagmography, videonystagmography and MRI.
peptic ulcer disease;Peptic ulcers are open sores that develop on the inside lining of your stomach and the upper portion of your small intestine.;To detect an ulcer, your doctor may first take a medical history and perform a physical exam. You then may need to undergo diagnostic tests, such as: lab tests for H. pylori, endoscopy, upper gastrointestinal series.
pityriasis rosea;Pityriasis rosea is a rash that usually begins as a large circular or oval spot on your chest, abdomen or back. Called a herald patch, this spot can be up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) across.;In most cases, your doctor can identify pityriasis rosea simply by looking at the rash. The doctor may take a small scraping of the rash for testing, as this condition can sometimes be confused with ringworm (tinea corporis).
pityriasis rubra pilaris;Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is the name given to a group of rare skin disorders that present with reddish-orange coloured scaling patches with well-defined borders. They may cover the entire body or just parts of the body such as the elbows and knees, palms and soles.;PRP is diagnosed clinically from its time course and clinical appearance, with skin biopsy findings being supportive.
pneumonia;Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.;If pneumonia is suspected, the doctor may recommend the following tests: blood tests, chest X-ray, pulse oximetry, sputum test.
psoriasis;Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes red, itchy scaly patches, most commonly on the knees, elbows, trunk and scalp.;Your doctor will ask questions about your health and examine your skin, scalp and nails. Your doctor might take a small sample of skin (biopsy) for examination under a microscope.
schizophrenia;Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling. People with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment.;Diagnosis of schizophrenia involves ruling out other mental health disorders and determining that symptoms are not due to substance abuse, medication or a medical condition.
sciatica;Sciatica most commonly occurs when a herniated disk, bone spur on the spine or narrowing of the spine (spinal stenosis) compresses part of the nerve. This causes inflammation, pain and often some numbness in the affected leg.;During the physical exam, your doctor may check your muscle strength and reflexes. For example, you may be asked to walk on your toes or heels, rise from a squatting position and, while lying on your back, lift your legs one at a time. Pain that results from sciatica will usually worsen during these activities.
seborrheic dermatitis;Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin condition that mainly affects your scalp. It causes scaly patches, red skin and stubborn dandruff.;The diagnosis determined by examining your skin. The doctor may scrape off skin cells for examination (biopsy) to rule out conditions with symptoms similar to seborrheic dermatitis.
sinus infection;Sinusitis (sinus infection) is an inflammation or swelling of the tissue lining the sinuses. Sinuses are hollow spaces within the bones between your eyes, behind your cheekbones, and in your forehead. They make mucus, which keeps the inside of your nose moist. That, in turn, helps protect against dust, allergens, and pollutants.;The doctor may ask about your symptoms and feel for tenderness in your nose and face and look inside your nose in a physical exam.
sleep apnea;Sleep apnea is a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts.;An evaluation often involves overnight monitoring at a sleep center of your breathing and other body functions during sleep. Tests to detect sleep apnea include: Nocturnal polysomnography and home sleep tests.
tuberculosis;Tuberculosis (TB) is a potentially serious infectious disease that mainly affects the lungs. The bacteria that cause tuberculosis are spread from person to person through tiny droplets released into the air via coughs and sneezes.;The most commonly used diagnostic tool for tuberculosis is a skin test, though blood tests are becoming more commonplace. A small amount of a substance called tuberculin is injected just below the skin on the inside of your forearm. Within 48 to 72 hours, a health care professional will check your arm for swelling at the injection site. A hard, raised red bump means you're likely to have TB infection. The size of the bump determines whether the test results are significant.
typhoid;Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella typhi bacteria. Typhoid fever is rare in developed countries. It is still a serious health threat in the developing world, especially for children. Contaminated food and water or close contact with an infected person cause typhoid fever.;Your doctor is likely to suspect typhoid fever based on your symptoms and your medical and travel history. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by identifying Salmonella typhi in a culture of your blood or other body fluid or tissue.
ulcerative colitis;Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and ulcers (sores) in your digestive tract. Ulcerative colitis affects the innermost lining of your large intestine (colon) and rectum.;Endoscopic procedures with tissue biopsy are the only way to definitively diagnose ulcerative colitis.
urinary tract infection;A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of your urinary system — your kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract — the bladder and the urethra.;Tests and procedures used to diagnose urinary tract infections include: urine testing, growing urinary tract bacteria in a lab, imaging of urinary tract, cystoscopy.
varicose veins;Varicose veins are twisted, enlarged veins. Any superficial vein may become varicosed, but the veins most commonly affected are those in your legs.;To diagnose varicose veins, your doctor will do a physical exam, including looking at your legs while you're standing to check for swelling. Your doctor may also ask you to describe any pain and aching in your legs. You also may need an ultrasound test to see if the valves in your veins are functioning normally or if there's any evidence of a blood clot.
